# Fooddie-app
This is an app in the beginner stages . 

This app will be an android app

This app will use Open CV.


The user to scan an image of the food that they are eating 
and show how many calories are in each meal
The app will be created by scrapping images from the internet and in java 


I would also like to develop this app to allow the user to look up healthy eating recipes and excercises to help loose weight at home
